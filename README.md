I am Doctorated in engineering of Energy systems, 
a machine engineer,
retired colonel from Turkish Navy
have 4 patents about energy producing by natural sources
was a teacher in MSK University till last 2 years.
I and my colleague have built and used a machine that separates the waste sludge from sewage treatment systems and converts them into usable items (such as fuel, gas, coal and urea).
we have developed a mirror-oriented system that extracts fresh water from sea water. It can also generate electricity. These are very cheap and simple ways for every body.
Now I study about gold and silver mining in North Turkey and need some fund. We are looking for funds for partnership. This business has reserves of approximately 1 billion dollars.
